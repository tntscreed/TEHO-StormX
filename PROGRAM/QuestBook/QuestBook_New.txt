Captive smuggler
#TEXT 1
I agreed to help a band of smugglers in rescuing their captain sitting in the prison of @<cityName>. Surely I'd be better off without soiling my hands with this affair, but they've offered me a decent reward. I should talk to the commandant... or, perhaps, it's better to turn all those gallowbirds to the authorities?
#TEXT 2
Being occupied with more important affairs, I have forgotten about the captain, liberated from the prison, and the deal with his boys. The rascal must have used his opportunity to sneak away. Well, so be it.
#TEXT 3
I liberated the captain of the smugglers and received my reward. Money has no smell.
#TEXT 4
I liberated the captain of the smugglers from the prison, but these scoundrels decided to deceive me! Alright, now they can strike their deals with the devil!
#TEXT 5
I informed the authorities of the town about the smugglers' plans - they can handle it by themselves from this point on.
#TEXT 6
Part of the smugglers managed to get away. The governor will surely be displeased with my slowness.
#TEXT 7
All smugglers got what they deserved. Now I need to report to the governor, and the deal is done.


#QUEST AffairOfHonor
Matter of honour
#TEXT 1
By a chance, I met a very bad-mannered officer. I'll have to teach him some manners and uphold the honor of the girl. So, in two hours at the lighthouse we'll meet.
#TEXT 2
The churl is punished, and the outraged honor is upheld! I must tell this pleasant news to the girl. Quickly back to the town!
#TEXT 2_1
Oh hell. I missed the duel. What a fool I am.
#TEXT 3
A miserable father, a good-for-nothing son, the lady's honor... Alright, let's see how it ends up this time. Let’s visit the tavern and the brothel for starters.
#TEXT 3_1
Excellent! Now there's only one little thing left - to slaughter the scoundrel.
#TEXT 4
The deed is done, and father and son can sleep well... until the next time. Oh, and I deserved a reward. Let's collect it!
#TEXT 4_1
Well, I missed it - so what? No big deal.
#TEXT 5
Are things looking that black, if the authorities are issuing letters of marque to random rascals and drunkards? I should visit the tavern and see, who is terrorizing the local populace.
#TEXT 6
One scoundrel less in this world. It's nice to do good deeds.
#TEXT 6_1
I have changed my mind - I won't fight. I'm just not in the mood. Besides, the girl should taste all delights of being a concubine of a brave corsair compared to being a maid in the tavern.
#TEXT 7
A duel! And the reason can't be any weightier.
#TEXT 8
The insolent fellow got his due.
#TEXT 8_1
Perhaps I chickened out... I don't know.
#TEXT 9
A citizen told me about an intriguing way of making money: robbing partners at the game of cards, then accusing them of cheating and later killing them in a duel to awoid the spreading of undesired gossips. I should check out if it is true.
#TEXT 10
Yes, the citizen was right. Poor Tom, like the others, too, fell victim to the rascal. But I have put an end to this.
#TEXT 10_1
Pfff! Cards, sharpers, duels... I've got no time for this crap!
#TEXT 11
A fencing teacher is afraid of a fight - who would believe it! The governor's nephew will have a hard time with a teacher like that. But it's not my business, anyway. I'd rather see the merchant.
#TEXT 12
The mercenary is dead. Let's tell the teacher good news.
#TEXT 12_1
That mercenary looked like a very tough guy. I decided not to fight him.
#TEXT 13
Yeah, this days the officers are not like they used to be. But even those strive to be killed in a duel istead of perishing in a glorious combat. Well, I only need to make sure that the more worthy will live on. I have two days at most. I should start with the search for the mistress.
#TEXT 14
It seems that the officer I knew was lucky as opposed to the officer I haven't known, who is now dead. Now I should heed the advice of the seconds and leave the town for a while.
#TEXT 14_1
I decided to not interfere with someone else's affairs. Let them solve their own problems by themselves.
#TEXT 15
'Divine Justice' sounds great! I will have to interfere and defend the plantator in a duel.
#TEXT 16
An ambush! I should have fugured it out. Now the plantator should have weighty arguments against his neighbor. Now to collect my reward: surely it was well deserved.
#TEXT 16_1
Interesting, can I now expect discounts from the local smugglers?

#QUEST BurntShipQuest
Burnt ship in @<cityName>
#TEXT 1
Harbor master @<portmanName> from @<cityName> asked me to find an extraordinary ship with a specific characteristic @<text>. He offered me a very decent reward. I have half of a year at my disposal.
#TEXT 2
Well, it seems that harbor master @<portmanName> resolved all his issues by himself. I don't think he came off as a loser, anyway.
#TEXT 3
The harbor master was not so simple and he gave the insurance money to the usurer. Well, I still have the ship. Let's see how this works out.
#TEXT 4
I have received a reward for a unique ship - @<money> pesos. For such money, two similar ships can be bought. I must admit that the harbor master surely knows his business and can persuade the insurance guys.
#TEXT 5
I decided to keep the ship for myself. It seemed to me that @<money> pesos is just too small a price for such a gorgeous ship.


#QUEST GiveShipLetters
Found documents
#TEXT   1
A curious find! Someone was either in hurry or just too absentminded - either way, he had lost a full set of a ship's documents. I am certain that their owner will soon announce his loss.  
#TEXT   2
Well, I did a favour to nice people, and it didn't cost me any effort.
#TEXT   3
Well, the world is not without good people. It's great that the owner will soon recover his loss!
#TEXT   4
Well, the world is not without good people. It was lucky that I dropped in to the shipyard.
#TEXT   5
The reward was small, but I spent almost no effort, anyway.
#TEXT   6
Perhaps, it's for the best. I gained little, but at least I don't have to bother myself with these documents now.
#TEXT   7
It's great when the merchant and the merchandise find each other so fortunately!
#TEXT   8
It's great when your favour is rewarded accordingly!
#TEXT   9
Unicuique secundum opera eius! The documents will soon return to their owner - and money has already slipped into my pocket.
#TEXT  10
I should have delivered these documents earlier, that way their owner wouldn't have to obtein a new set of documents.


#QUEST ReasonToFast
A reason to hurry
#TEXT   1
A cute girl blabbed out that an officer from the garrison was hurrying to some cove so much that it had even distracted him from his fun and games. Perhaps it's worth investigating?
#TEXT   2
There are many windbags around. Perhaps, I was just imagining things?
#TEXT   3
Perhaps, I just gave way to the offended girl. I shouldn't have thought up what was missing...
#TEXT   4
What an ill luck! That guy showed up at the very wrong time. Now it is too late to guess what they were up to...
#TEXT   5
It turned out that I was tracked by a pirate messenger, the patrolman was waiting for him here. But it seems I managed to pretend to be the messenger, @<sName>.
#TEXT   6
I tracked down the corrupt patrol officer and was convinced that he had dealings with pirates. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to arrest him. Still, he was duly punished.
#TEXT   7
I failed to talk to the patrol officer. Ah, hell with him, anyway!..
#TEXT   8
What an ill luck! The patrol officer died, and his mistery died with him...
#TEXT   9
Judas in the military seeks to get his 30 'pieces' of silver. Interesting, what kind of favor can cost such a pile of @<sText>?
#TEXT   10
A qyestionable bargain! Still, @<sName> would not hunt this map without a reason.
#TEXT   11
@<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' with a cargo of @<sGoodsName> is hanging around without an escort. That's some useful information...
#TEXT   12
The governor keeps his valuables in his own boudoir? How careless of him...
#TEXT   13
Thanks God, this is finally over!
#TEXT   14
A nice blade is a great reward! It's also worth seeing whether this map can cost a handful of gems!
#TEXT   15
I got a hold on a pirate map. I need to check whether it's worth the money as soon as I can!
#TEXT   16
Huh... That's how your trust in justice can turn against you... I was suspected in an attack on the patrolling party...
#TEXT   17
This affair was finally over, and, it seems, I didn't come off as a loser!
#TEXT   18
The lead of the patrolman was correct! The great prize will surely more than cover all my expenses.
#TEXT   19
How unfortunate. I failed to make any good of the information purchased for a crapload of money.
#TEXT   20
I had to give @<sText> just in order to not hear the hot breath of @<sName> behind my back. Next time I shall be more cautious when undertaking such adventures.
#TEXT   21
@<sName> will not part with @<sText> easily. I need to get out of here, and quickly.
#TEXT   22
It turned out that the pirates somehow learned about the blunder of the patrol officer. Well, it is his funeral, most likely, he's already dead, anyway, and it's high time for me to get out of here… It seems that there is no one left to tell @<sName> about my deeds...
#TEXT   23
The pirates knew that I had the map of @<sName>. Moreover, they also knew about the island where he had hidden his treasures. It's good that their wits were no match for their greed, as they failed to find the treasure before I did.      
#TEXT   24
Considering that the forces were unequal, I was forced to hand over the treausre to treasure hunters of @<sName>. Next time I shall be more cautious when undertaking such adventures.  
#TEXT   25
I managed to sink a pirate ship, on which this operation involving the patrol officer was orchestrated. The patrolman himself must surely be dead by now, the pirates never forgive blunder like that one... Well, it seems that there is no one left to tell @<sName> about my deeds...
#TEXT   26
I managed to come off clear out of this story with the patrolman. I don't think the pirates will chase me forever. Surely they have other things to do.


#QUEST PiratesOnUninhabited
@<shoreName>
#TEXT 1
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They asked to deliver them to any inhabited cove. Well, I can understand them - they are at odds with the law, after all...
#TEXT 2
I delivered the shipwrecked pirates to @<toShore> and even received a small reward. Surely, it wasn't much, but still will not hurt...
#TEXT 3
I delivered the pirates from the uninhabited island to @<toShore>. But, these scoundrels demanded that I land them money. I was forced to explain them that I don't lend money to any of their kind.
#TEXT 4
I delivered the pirates from the uninhabited island to @<toShore> and have even loaned them some money... I can't imagine how I would have struggled out of these dire straits, were I in their shoes...
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They asked to deliver them to any inhabited cove in exchange for a treasure map. Well, we'll see about the map... Or should I just turn them in to the authorities? In that case I am sure to receive my reward...
#TEXT 6
The rascal chose to trick me, but in the end he paid for this.
#TEXT 7
The rascal didn’t have the map on him, but he told me where captain @<capName> had hidden his loot. I'll have to check @<toShore>.
#TEXT 8
I don't know whether the treasure was in @<shore> or not. I failed to find it. Well, I can't say my expenses were too big, anyway.
#TEXT 9
The pirate was right. In @<shore> I have found a nice treasure indeed...
#TEXT 10
That pirate is surely no simple guy. It turned out that he has promised that treasure not just to me. Well, either way in the end I was the one to claim it.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. I should deliver them to any inhabited cove. Or simply turn them in to the authorities.
#TEXT 12
I decided that a bird in hand is better than two in the bush and turned the pirates in to governor @<mayorName>. I think it was the right thing to do, at least, the money is already jingling in my pocket.
#TEXT 13
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors, put ashore by captain @<badCapName>. They claim that captain is sailing on @<ship> and deals in slaves. We have agreed to find him. If everything goes as planned, I will take the contents of the hold, and they'll get the ship.
#TEXT 14
I boarded @<ship>, and in her hold I have actually found the slaves. Well, it turns out that having friends among pirates pays off sometimes...  
#TEXT 15
I had to sink @<ship> and finish off the pirates as well. I guess no one will be upset about it.
#TEXT 16
In the heat of a battle I have sunk @<ship>/ I had to compensate her cost to the pirates. I couldn't have left them without any means for existence, after all, could I?

#QUEST ShipWrecked
The shipwrecked
#TEXT 1
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> '@<ShipName>'. I should deliver them to any settlement of @<sNation>.
#TEXT 2
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors, put ashore by captain @<badCapName>. I should deliver them to any settlement of @<sNation>.

#TEXT 4
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors, put ashore by captain @<badCapName>. I should deliver them to any nearest settlement.
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName> I have met @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> '@<ShipName>'. Their captain should have taken too many blows in the head, he demands to deliver him to Dunkirk. I have no clue what to do with them. So far, I have taken them onboard. I couldn't just leave them in this deserted place.
#TEXT 6
I delivered captain @<sName> and his sailors to @<sCity> and have even received a small reward. Not too much, but won't hurt, either.
#TEXT 7
This insane captain demands to be delivered to Dunkirk and just don't want to leave my ship! His behaviour becomes absolutely intolerable! I have no clue what to do in this situation!
#TEXT 8
That nutcase finally got what he was asking for. I had to finish him off. I simply had no other choice. He was talking about unimaginable treasures, while not having even a spoon. What a crook...
#TEXT 9
Finally I managed to get rid of that shipwreck survivor and he even has slipped me some piece of a map. I must cut and run, before he realizes that I have tricked him. He-he... Dunki-irk... Dunki-iiirk...
#TEXT 10
At @<shoreName> I have met the shipwrecked sailors. I should tell about them the governor of the nearest settlement of @<sNation>. I guess, the provisions I have left for them will last long enough until the rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName> I met several sailors, put ashore by pirate @<sBadName>. I should tell about them the governor of the nearest settlement of @<sNation>. I guess, the provisions I have left for them will last long enough until the rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 12
I was too busy to return to that ill-fated cove. I can only hope that those poor souls were found and rescued by some other captain...
#TEXT 13
I told the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors, abandoned at @<ShoreName>, but I have taken too long. Now we can only pray to the Lord that help will arrive in time...
#TEXT 14
I told the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors, abandoned at @<ShoreName> and have even received a small reward. The governor was delighted to hear that the captain of the wrecked ship managed to survive. He will set up a rescue expedition at once.
#TEXT 15
I delivered captain @<sName> and his sailors to the nearest settlement and was rewarded very handsomely, although I never asked for this...
#TEXT 16
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard captain @<sName> and @<count> his sailors. Captain claims that pirate @<sBadName> instigated his crew to a mutiny, deprived him of his ship and put the puur guys ashore. I promised him to seek out his ship '@<ShipName>' and return it back to him, whereas I will receive the contents of her hold.
#TEXT 17
As we had agreed, I delivered the captain and his sailors to the settlement. My only reward was their thanks, but it didn't cost me anything anyway.
#TEXT 18
I boarded @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' and, according to our deal, gave it back to @<sName>, I took the contents of the hold for myself. Justice was served.
#TEXT 19
In the heat of battle @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' has been sunk and the contents of her hold, obviously, were lost as well. I feel very badly for captain @<sName>. But what was done, is done.


#QUEST JungleGirl
Damsel in the jungle
#TEXT 1
I promised @<sName> from the settlement of @<sCity> to bring her @<sText1> large and @<sText2> small pearls for the necklace of her mistress. I have only 10 days - otherwise all my efforts could be in vain.
#TEXT 2
In exchange for the pearls @<sName> gave me a very nice amulet. Indeed, you never know where you lose something and when you gain something.
#TEXT 3
I failed to collect enough pearls for @<sName>. I feel sorry for the girl, but it's her fault, after all, she shouldn't have applied for work with such a fickle mistress...
#TEXT 4
@<sName> claims that she knows the location where her father, notorious pirate @<sPirateName>, has hidden his treasure. It's @<sTreasureLoc>. We should disembark at @<sShore>. After we find the treasure, I'll need to deliver her back to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 5
@<sName> is dead, and I don't know the place where the chests are hidden. Pity, but this time I was out of luck.
#TEXT 5_1
I decided not to bother myself with the search for @<sName>'s father treasure. She can deal with it by herself, if she chooses to.
#TEXT 6
The treasure of @<sPirateName> was vast indeed. I received my half. Now I need to deliver @<sName> back home, to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 7
@<sName> died. I feel sorry for the girl, she's just became rich... What a stupid death...
#TEXT 8
I delivered @<sName> home with her treasure. As a token of her gratitude she made me a very nice gift… Indeed, it's very nice to make people happy...
#TEXT 9
Daughter of @<sText> in the settlement of @<sCity> has run away from home. She claimed that she hated to marry the usurer's son, and she begged me to take her to her chosen one, @<sLover>. And what should I do with her? I would hate to spoil her life for the rest of her days, but I can understand her parents as well...
#TEXT 10
@<sName> died… That's what happens when the young ones pay no heed for their parents...
#TEXT 11
I handed the runaway to the guards. Let them decide what to do with her...
#TEXT 12
In the settlement of @<sCity> the girl ran away from me, as well. Well, I can only hope that she finds her happiness, for which she is willing to sacrifice everything. Oh, the youth...
#TEXT 13
I took the runaway to her father, and I am certain it was the right thing to do. What can be worse than the woe of the parents who lost their only child? And her father rewarded me handsomely.
#TEXT 14
I took the girl to her chosen one. From now they can go on on their own, I am not their nanny.
#TEXT 15
I have undertaken to deliver the loving copule to the town of @<sCity>, to the parents of her new groom. I think this is the right thing to do.
#TEXT 16
I have delivered the loving couple where I promised. Now, I should go to @<sText> and claim my reward from groom's father. I wonder how much happy will he be to see me?
#TEXT 17
I decided not to bother the groom's parents, surely they must have other concerns. Besides, my expences in this affair were very small, anyway.
#TEXT 18
The groom's father thanked me and made me a very decent gift… I feel almost jealous for these two young lovers...
#TEXT 19
Seems that it was a waste of my time. Groom's father turned out a real miser. I almost feel sorry for the young couple - neither of them had any luck with their parents... People are too hard-hearted in this back of beyond and wouldn't talk of anything beside gold. Still, I am glad that I managed to help the young ones. They deserve a different life.
#TEXT 20
I have undertaken to deliver the girl @<sName>, who had fled from the brothel in @<sBrothelCity>, to her parents in @<sCity>.
#TEXT 21
I have undertaken to bring to @<sName>, who had fled from the brothel, her gripsack. I'll need to look for it in the privacy room. Inside there should be some money, documents, a decent dress and other belongings of the poor girl.
#TEXT 22
I was too busy and had to leave the girl in the tavern. Still, I hope that she is smart enough  to deal with it by herself.
#TEXT 23
I did everthing I could. I can only hope that @<sName> makes it safely to her home.
#TEXT 24
I delivered @<sName> to the settlement of @<sCity>. I didn't bring her to her parents, they will surely have other concerns...
#TEXT 25
I delivered @<sName> home. I was rewarded with a decent blade and also deep moral satisfaction.
#TEXT 26
I delivered @<sName> home. I was rewarded with a great musket and also deep moral satisfaction.
#TEXT 27
I delivered @<sName> home. Her brother offered me to partake in a joint raid against the pirates, but I had to refuse.


#QUEST ShipEpidemy
Epidemic on the ship
#TEXT 1
It seems I have caught an infection. Apparently, the captain of '@<sShipName>' was not kidding about the epidemic. I will need to minimize my interactions with the crew and be more careful in the future.
#TEXT 2
The epidemic is declining. I have appetite again, what means that I am getting well, thanks God.
#TEXT 3
We have epidemic on the ship. The sailors are perishing to disease. The captain of boarded '@<sShipName>', may he burn in hell, was not kidding... What do we have to do now? May the Holy Virgin save us all.
#TEXT 4
The disease is declining. Praise the Most Holy Mother of God! In the future, I definitely need to be more careful...

#QUEST ChurchGenQuest1
Return the manuscripts to the priest of @<sCity>
#TEXT	1
Holy father @<sName> tasked me with an errand: bring precious theosophical manuscripts, given by him for the sake of enlightement and by the order of his superiors to the priest of @<sOwnerCity>, which he hasn't promptly returned. I undertook to help him in resolving of this delicate matter.
#TEXT 2
Adult men, servants of God and acting like little children! Well, not a big deal, the most important thing is that I have the manuscripts! Now to take them back to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 3_1
Well, it's amazing to see how people try to vindicate their lazyness and irresponsibility by some high purpose. How could one give such priceless things to a random person without any warranties? What a careless priest... Now I must chase that @<sCapName>, captain of "@<sShipName>" across the entire archipelago.
#TEXT 3_2
That will be not an easy task to seek for a ship, a name of which I don't know. And I must act quickly, before that God-fearing captain gets rid of these precious books... but the first thing to do is to find out, what is that SACRED name written by @<sCapName> on the backside of his old tub?
#TEXT 4
I wonder - why should I be the one paying for someone's religious impulses?! Goddammit! I do hope that near the colony of @<sColony> I will finally catch up with this old tub "@<sShipName>" and her God-fearing captain at the helm, and I will get these papers from him. Perhaps, the Lord will absolve me of a couple sins for that.
#TEXT 5
Out of luck again. That @<sName> is surely an interesting guy: the priest entrusted to him an extremely valuable cargo, but the port officials are trembling just at the sound of his name. Well, we'll see how it works out, when we finally meet in @<sColony>...
#TEXT 6
That captain is surely an interesting person. Well, it's time to meet him face to face, take those longed-for books from him and deliver them to their rightful owner in @<sColony>.
#TEXT 7
Today I have handed the priest of @<sColony> his precious manuscripts and received my reward together with a warning against the mortal sin of greed.
#TEXT 7_2
Old fool @<sCapName> made a debt in the tavern and gave to the owner precious books and manuscripts as a pledge. Expenses and expenses again... I will buy out the manuscripts and finally deliver them to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 8
Another expense in my ledger: I have paid the debt of an old cachalot @<sName> in the tavern. The manuscripts of the priest in the colony of @<sColony> have been bought out, and now it's time to return his longed-for manuscripts to him and show him my expenses book as well!
#TEXT 9
In fact, there are yet unselfish tavern owners around. I will hurry to @<sColony> to return the theisophical manuscripts and tell the story about a tavern keeper, who gave away priceless books only to uphold his vow.
#TEXT 10
Oh, my... I would never imagine that such a simple task will be so time and effort consuming. Well, at least the God-fearing captain @<sCapName> didn't cause me any trouble - he gave me the precious manuscripts and told me to get lost, what I gladly did. Now back to @<sColony>. 

#QUEST ChurchGenQuest2
Church robbery in @<sCity>.
#TEXT	1
Stealing the church money! What's wrong with this world?! Well, while Father @<sName> is bringing curses upon the heads of these scoffers, I should undertake more effective actions - and if the Lord does not reward me for them, then Padre certainly will... They couldn't have gone far...
#TEXT	2
People in the town say that the money was stolen by the local bandits, who were smart enough to go in hiding. Perhaps I should visit their hunting grounds.
#TEXT	3
Indeed, God gives everyone his due - the bandits got what they deserved, and I got the church money. Now back to see Father.
#TEXT	4
Isn't that nice? I did a favor to God and didn't forget about myself, either. A blessing!
#TEXT	5
That's even more than I could expect! Indeed, working for the church really pays off sometimes!
#TEXT	6
Well, I am rich and I am cursed. Whatever. With such money I don't care neither about God nor about Devil.
#TEXT	7
The jungle is full of scoundrels of all sorts, but I still haven't found those I was looking for. I'll have to get back to the town to get more precise information regarding their whereabouts.
#TEXT	8
The stealers of the church property were smarter than I thought, and they fled the settlement. I must hurry to @<sCity> on @<sIsland>, before they have wasted all their money on booze and hookers!
#TEXT	9
Well, smugglers turned out to be easy to come to an agreement with. They helped the scoundrels for money, and they betrayed them for money. Alright, to @<sShore>, then.
#TEXT	10_1
Now that's quite a story... Could Father @<sName> indeed be so treacherous? Well, anyway I should talk to him first - it might be that I am suspecting a complettely innocent man...
#TEXT	10_2
Now that's quite a story... Could Father @<sName> indeed be so treacherous? Well, since I have killed all those scoundrels, no one but the padre himself can now confirm of disprove their words...
#TEXT	11_1
Finally I have found the scounrels. Surely, this was no Holy Grail, but still... Well, it's time to go back.
#TEXT	11_2
I hope that I did something good and when Doomsday comes, the Almighty will credit it on my account - I shared my belongings with the unfortunate in order to reveal them the way of righteousness. By the way, I'll need to tell the Father that his church property was likely used for the same purpose as well...
#TEXT	11_3
Who could have thought that the church property can be so expensive... Well, at least I got something in exchange for the money. I'll bring the chalice to the padre - perhaps it will sooth his grief for the stolen cash...
#TEXT	11_4
Being poor is no sin... being a liar is! And God has rewarded such nobleness: the scoundrels who defied Him shall be put down, the church property will be saved, and I will receive my due reward!
#TEXT	12_1
I would like to believe that the repentance of the priest of @<sCity> was sincere. Of course, I have lost something from the material point of view - but moral satisfaction more than makes up for it!
#TEXT	12_2
What a twist of events! It turns out that even the priests can fall victim to greed. But, as they say, all is well that ends well. Father @<sName> managed to cope with his temptation and even compensated my expenses.
#TEXT	12_3
What a twist of events! It turns out that even the priests can fall victim to greed. But, as they say, all is well that ends well. Father @<sName> managed to cope with his temptation. But he forgot to compensate my expences - perhaps he was too excited. I had to reming him about it.

In these times driven by greed Devil can seduce even the clergy, not to mention the laymen. Well, it might seem stupid, but I didn't take the dirty money of that crook in the soutane.

Indeed, our Lord is merciful, if He allows sinners like Father @<sName> to decieve their credulous congregation. I am not as  good-natured, and I'd be happy to turn in that crook to the authorities - but, unfortunately, I have no solid evidence of his collusion... Well, that's enough good deeds in out Lord's name. I was lucky enough to make that crook compensate my expenses, though.

I still could not cast off my suspicions regarding the priest of @<sCity>. Of course, the word of a priest weighs more than that of a bandit, but this entire story stinks. Well, that's enough good deeds in out Lord's name - all I am left with are expenses and disappointments.
#TEXT	12_8
Father accepted the news that all the church money was in the end wasted on booze for the bandits. Well, my expenses haven't paid up as well, if that can be a consolation for him.
#TEXT	12_9
That was not something a good Christian should have done, but the parish will not become poorer, and my expenses will be covered at least partially. The important thing is that the thieves didn't get a hold of the church coffers.
#TEXT	12_10
To appropriate the church money and to receive a reward for it is surely not the most virtuous deed, but... If I don't change the rigging, any of the sailors may fall down to death, and this sin will be on my soul... As for the Father, I take a vow to donate to his church three times much money as I have taken!
#TEXT	12_11
Will the Lord forgive me? He the only one might know, why I deceived the openhearted priest? That alone was a sin, but it was even a greater sin to accept money, which he gave me in his limitless kindness to console me.

No money! No glory! All I was left with are filthy insinuations!!! I will never deal with these hypocrites again!

The Bible says that all trials we face are given by the Lord according to our strengths, and God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. Well, it seems that I have lost my strength, and this burden bacame too heavy for me. I hope that Father @<sName> will understand, when I tell him that I had failed his mission.

Captain of @<sShipName>, @<sCapName>, before he died, had asked me to tell @<sCharName> from @<sCity> that he didn't have time to do his errand. I will have to find this man. The last will of the dying man should be respected...

I decided to not waste time on petty business. Surely that man must have long forgotten about that errand of his.

@<sCharName> offered me to ransom his captive @<sCharType>. I didn't agree to that, pleading being busy.

@<sCharName> from @<sCity> asked me to deliver 150 000 pesos to @<sPirateName> in @<sPirateCity>, to liberate his @<sFamilyType> @<sSlaveName>, held by the pirates in waiting for ransom. When I return, I will receive 40 000 pesos for the job well done.

I was caught in dire straits. It turns out that @<sCapName> was delivering @<sPirateName> in @<sPirateCity> a ransom for some captive @<sSlaveName> - 3 chests of gold. That type, @<sCharName>, told me that his assignment still holds. If I don't bring @<sSlaveName> to the tavern of @<sCity> in 30 days, he promised to set bounty hunters upon my trail... But how could I have missed these chests in the cabin of the late captain?! 
#TEXT	6
I failed to complete @<sCharName>'s assignment, but he must forgive me. After all, I could have perished just like captain @<sCapName>.
#TEXT	7
Well, the time allotted to deliver the captive has run out. Let's see, what this menacing mister @<sCharName> will do now.
#TEXT	8
I decided to turn down @<sCharName>'s mission. He might feel offended, but I returned him the money, after all.
#TEXT	9
I have liberated the captive. Now I must deliver him to @<sCharName> in @<sCity>.
#TEXT	10
@<sName> got tired of waiting for a ransom to arrive and sold his captive to a plantation on Barbados. Well, that must be for the best - surely a slave cannot cost more than a hostage. I must hurry to Barbados to visit colonel Bishop.

I paid for @<sName> @<sSum> pesos. Now I must hurry in @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. He must be worried, poor soul. And a reward wouldn't hurt, either.
#TEXT	12
A blunder with the chests has cost me a lot. I paid for @<sName> a hefty sum of @<sSum> pesos. But the captive was not so simple and he offered me to take him to @<sCity> in exchange for some very valuable information. I agreed, since that the client didn't seem to be willing to pay me anything.

A blunder with the chests has cost me a lot. I paid for @<sName> a hefty sum of @<sSum> pesos. It seems that the liberated guy doesn't want to meet with my client at all, but this is not my business. I don't need any more trouble because of this ragamuffin.

#TEXT	23
I notified @<sCharName> about the death of @<sName>, his relative, and returned him the ransom money - 150 000 pesos. Of course, I could have demanded to compensate my expenses, but hardly in this case.

@<sName> charged me with the task of sinking two pirate vessels -  '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>', which went to @<sShoreName> on @<sShoreType>. I must manage in 15 days, before they clear the cache.

I failed to catch up with the pirates. Surely they have cleared the cache by now. I'll have to return to @<sName> empty-handed.

I didn't pay such outrageous sum. Ransoming a hostage is one thing, but buying a plantation slave is a different story... I wonder, did Bishop reinforce the guard after the incident, or is he still saving?
#TEXT	31
@<sName> doesn't want to part with his captive without a ransom. Well, I'll have to either find the money or just abandon the whole matter.
#TEXT	32
I told @<sName> about the captive's death. It seems that now he is in the same hopeless position he had put me in before.

The authorities have sniffed something out about him... @<sShipTypeNom> sails from @<sCity2> and will arrive to the port of @<sCity11> in 10-15 days. I must catch up with it.

I change my mind and will not deal with @<sName>. Let him face the consequences alone.

It seems that an ambush was set up at @<sShoreName> - the patrol showed up way too quickly. Captain @<sName> was killed in the skirmish. The sailors have scoured the cove, but haven't found the cache. Perhaps, the authorities have already cleared it...
#TEXT	10
The cargo is in the holds. My share is @<sGoodsQuantity> pieces of @<sGoods>. It is time for us to part. We should hurry before the crown sents hunters for our heads.

#TEXT	12
A patrol squadron was already waiting for us at the exit out of the cove. We had to accept battle. @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' with a hold full of @<sGoods> has sunk, and captain @<sName> with it as well.

I failed to escort @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' in time, and captain @<sName> refused to pay me my reward. Still, I didn't come off as a loser, anyway.

Finally, captain @<sName> revealed his cache, but he couldn't stand the news that I was going to hand the whole cargo to the authorities. I had to use surgical intervention, and captain died as a result. Now I need to tell the governor of @<sCity> about the whereabouts of the cache.

It seems that captain @<sName> failed to share the booty with his crew. Had to lower the amount of those who wanted a cut. Besides, captain offered to buy out the booty for @<sSum> pesos. So I did it. And also hired him as an officer under my command. Every one is looking for such fighters.

It turns out that things are not as simple as they look like. Captain of the patrol @<sShipType>, @<sName>, was executed with part of his crew, but there was no evidence of his crime. I should meet with @<sCharName>, contused former cannoneer of @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>'.

Former cannoneer of @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>', @<sName>, told me the entire story of the death of @<sShipTypeQuest> '@<sShipNameQuest>'. But that confused guy asked an outrageous price for the information about the cache. I refused to pay him.

I abandoned the whole affair with the cache of captain @<sName>. May the former cannoneer @<sCharName> forgive me, but he asked just too much for it, and I have more important things to do.

I need to prepare the hold and come to @<sShoreName> after midnight - @<sName> will be waiting for me there.
#TEXT	44
I foolishly missed my chance to scavenge the cache of captain @<sName>! Perhaps, @<sCharName> didn't wait for me, or, maybe, he decided to put me on. Either way, it was wasted time and money...

The smugglers cleaned out the cache of captain @<sName>. Or, perhaps, @<sCharName> decided to put me on and worked on both fronts. Either way, it was wasted time and money...
#TEXT	46
The smugglers found the cache of captain @<sName> before me. I had to recapture the cargo by force. Unfortunately, cannoneer @<sCharName> was perished. Ironically, all members of the crew of that ill-fated @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' are dead, and none of them managed to make any use of their heroic undertaking... I took all goods that fitted into my hold - @<sSum> units of @<sGoods>.
