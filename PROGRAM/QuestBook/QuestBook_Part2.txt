#TEXT	21_8
Something is very wrong! No sign of a corvette, yet Gontier and his men are walking around the streets. I must search the town and its outskirts.
#TEXT	21_9
Rat was hiding in one of the houses. I was attacked by his fellows as soon as I entered the room. I had to kill them though I doubt that they will be missed. Gontier has escaped. His lover told me that his corvette was staying near the lighthouse of Tortuga. I must sail there before he is gone again!
#TEXT	21_10
I was too slow and Gontier has managed to run away. No clues are left. I may return to my employer and report about the mission failure.

#TEXT	21_14
@<sName> was upset, yet he offered me to visit him in a month with a well-prepared squadron, next mission is going to be serious.

#TEXT	22_1
@<sName> ordered me to sail to Curacao which has suffered from a great runaway of slaves. I must find out more about this incident.
#TEXT	22_2

#TEXT	22_3
Harbor master told me only a barque's name - '@<sShipName>'. That is all I have, unfortunately. I can't even imagine where to dig next...
#TEXT	22_4
Surprisingly, I've learnt what I needed from a drunken sailor. The barque was seen at @<sAreal>. According to his story, the ship has suffered a wreckage. I should go there and search all the local bays.
#TEXT	22_5

Damn, I would never think that @<sName> is that serious! Now I have to capture fort of Havana, according to the information I got, there are 5 000 slaves. I am on my way.
#TEXT	25
The usurer was right. Two battleships are cruising near Havana's shores, they don't look really friendly. I must get rig of them before I will storm the fort.
#TEXT	26
Enemy's battleships were eliminated. Now it's time for the fort.
#TEXT	26_1
Enemy's battleships were eliminated, yet I am out of resources to assault Havana. I have to retreat. I suppose, there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT	27
Havana was taken, job is done. @<sQty> slaves were put in cargo holds. Time to return.
#TEXT	27_1
I failed the mission by attacking Havana from the landside. Slaves were kept inside the fort and defenders were able to prepare themselves. I suppose, there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT	28
I was too late and all slaves were taken to Cuba's plantations. I suppose, there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT	29
Damn it! Not all of slaves survived the voyage and the usurer wants 5 000, not a single slave less! I must find the rest in a week or I will get troubles otherwise.
#TEXT	30
I failed to deliver slaves in time. Now, there is no need to hurry - I have to sell slaves, visit agents, deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT	31
I failed to gather 5 000 slaves in time. Now I must deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT	32
Slaves were delivered to my employer. I should visit him in a week to collect my money. I will receive over a million for the job! Now, that why I should do this job! I can't even imagine what next mission will bring. Yes, this business will make me rich!
#TEXT	33
Fucking bastard has screwed me! When I arrived for my coins, it turned out that my dear 'partner' had run away, took my million and his investor's money. It's the first time I was cheated that hard! Yet he will get what he deserves. They all do. World is small, we might meet each other again. And the rat will pay for everything!

It looks like someone is trying to destroy merchant's business by selling goods illegally and cheap. I signed up to help. I think I should start with the local smugglers, they must have something to do about it...

My talk with smugglers was worthless. My mistake, I suppose. No clues are left, I suppose the merchant will have to deal with it himself.

I managed to cheat on smugglers - the have appointed me a meeting. I should come to the local harbor master's office at night, they will meet me there and show the way to that illegal shop. I can either talk with commandant and let him to deal with them or I can do it all myself...

I agreed, I will get all of their catch after all. Two schooners are watching Indians and there is a well defended camp on the shore. An important detail - I must approach them on a small ship like lugger or sloop in order to stay hidden long enough.
I have got only one month to do the job. So I'd better not waste any time.

I was too slow and Indians must be already taken away. Eh, my fault.. I will land Kanauri in the nearest port, I failed him.

False Trace
#TEXT   1
I had an interesting meeting in the port of @<sCity1>. A man called Adam Rayner offered me a deal. He told me about galleon '@<sShip>' loaded with silver. It is sailing from Cartagena to @<sCity2>. He demanded one tenth of the booty. I accepted his terms, considering that he will sail with me and he even asked to take part in the boarding party. Adam didn't tell me any timing yet I suppose that I have only two or three weeks.
#TEXT   2
Despite of my efforts, I failed to board the galleon. Whatever, hell with the silver.
#TEXT   3
I have sunk the galleon with all of it's silver. How could I be that inattentive...
#TEXT   4
Isn't that something! There was no silver inside the galleon. Captain says that it's only a fodder ship supposed to deliver provision. But there was also a woman, she is obviously the captain's lover. Right, I should call Adam in my cabin and have a talk. Let's see what this bastard will tell me in excuse. And he'd better try damn hard to save his neck from a rope...
#TEXT   5
Adam Rayner admitted that his plan was to capture the galleon with my help and to get his wife who has run away from him. Her name is Katerine Rayner. He offers to tell me about gold of some Squint-Eyed Solly as a reward for my 'services'. But, first, I have to deliver him and his wife to @<sCity>. Should I trust this rogue? Perhaps, I have to talk with his wife first, she might know something important...
#TEXT   6
It is getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam just like a dog hates a cat... That is why she ran away from him. But it is just their family matters and their problems. I didn't like Katerine and her proposal so I'd risk to trust Adam again. To @<sCity> then.
#TEXT   7
It is getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam just like a dog hates a cat... That is why she ran away from him. Katerine is eager to revenge her husband for organizing the attack which lead to her lover's death. She offered me to kill her husband and she will tell me about his hidden cache in return. I don't trust Adam anymore, so I have accepted her terms. I will sail to @<sCity> but I will land on the nearest shore not in the town. I will deal with Adam there.

Captain's offer was much more suspicious than Adam's. It looks like he is trying to set a trap for me. Not a chance! I'd better trust Adam one more time. I am heading to @<sCity>.
#TEXT   10
Captain's offer seemed much more profitable and interesting than Adam's one. Who lied once - will do it again. I will arrest Rayner and put him in the cargo hold.
#TEXT   11
Adam Rayner is arrested though he offered resistance. Now he is chained and I am heading to @<sShore>.
#TEXT   12
I was too slow and Adam Rayner had stolen a boat, took his wife and escaped from my ship. I doubt that I will see them again...
#TEXT   13
I was too slow and Squint-Eyed Solly has already taken his treasures. I should have tried better...
#TEXT   14
I have transported Adam and his wife to @<sCity>. Adam told me that Solly has left his booty inside the grotto at San Juan del Norte bay. I am heading there, only five days remaining.
#TEXT   15
I was too slow and Squint-Eyed Solly has already taken his treasures. I should have tried better...

As soon as I got aboard, I saw Solly's ship. Well, too bad for him then.
#TEXT   18
As soon as I got aboard, I saw Solly's ship. He was too strong for me, so I had to retreat and leave all the booty on the shore...

I have sunk the galleon with all of its gold. Such an idiot...

Heavy galleon was captured. Captain was right, there was a lot of gold!

Adam Rayner was killed in sight of his wife's as she have desired. It's odd but she was really pleased by the scene of his death. She told me about Adam's hidden cache - Port-au-Prince, lighthouse.
#TEXT   24
I've found Adam's cache. His gang attacked me while I was heading back to my boat. Katerine prepared the ambush, she wanted to revenge for her lover's death. It wasn't easy but I managed to kill all four bandits. Katerine was too confident and decided to watch my execution. And got a bullet in a skull for her treachery. No more surprises.

I have heard an interesting story from some drunk bounty hunter! It seems that a famous pirate Bartolomeo the Portuguese is somewhere in Philipsburg, he is looking for a doctor. Dutch West India Company will pay a great coin for his head. Hugo is right, I don't want to loose a chance like this. I should search the town and find the rat before it's gone!
#TEXT   2
I failed to find the pirate and I won't see any reward. Who knows, perhaps, it is for the best...
#TEXT   3
Hugo Avendell persuaded me to avoid local authorities and deliver the Portuguese straight to the Company. He thinks that the local governor will take away our prey and find a way to cheat on us. I should change the Portuguese's clothes, his men might still be in the town. I need to find him some appropriate clothes.
#TEXT   4
Damn it! I was too slow, Portuguese managed to run away from us. There is a smell of gunpowder in the room, poor doctor. I can forget about any reward now.
#TEXT   5
Doctor said that the Portuguese is too bad and he likely won't survive a trip to Curacao. My last chance is to take him to Gino Gvineili. If the genius won't be able to help him, no one will. But we are lacking of time, we have only three days.
#TEXT   6
I am late, fever did its job. Too bad that the pirate didn't live enough for the gallows...
#TEXT   7
We have arrived at Antigua and the Portuguese is still alive. I won't let my prisoner die before I receive my promised doubloons. But it is all about Gino and his skills now.
#TEXT   8
I knew that we have spent too much time here! They have finally tracked us down, but these are not the Portuguese men, they are mercs. I had to calm them down. Now we have only five days to reach Martinique. My prisoner will be able to rest in Saint-Pierre's tavern and live long enough to reach Curacao. Hugo suspects that there are more cutthroats around us, perhaps, I will be forced to fight them.
#TEXT   9
I was asked to visit his grace governor due to some important business. Interesting. Anyway, the Portuguese will be resting in the tavern for a few days, so I've got enough time to talk with monsieur Jacques Dille do Parquet. 
#TEXT   10
His grace is asking me to patrol the waters of his colony for two days, they have seen some pirate frigate recently. Well, fear has big eyes and I always can use more 10 000 pesos. I agreed, I have to stay here for a few days anyway while the Portuguese is resting...
#TEXT   11
Two days have passed and there is still no sign of pirate frigate. Time to see His Grace.
#TEXT   12
Hugo is an idiot! No, I am wrong... he is a coward! That is the best word to describe him. And why haven't I thrown him away before? He did nothing to help our deed. Fine, it will cost him in our sharing. Now I should check the tavern and talk with barman. He must have seen something!
#TEXT   13
I was able to find out that our client was taken from our loving arms by some Franz Garcke and Hernando Vazquez. Hugo knows them. He was frightened and ran away as soon as our cutthroats showed up. His participation in our business is getting more and more questionable. But it will wait, I am sure that they have taken our man to Le Francois, where else could men like them be hiding? Only under protection of the Kind Jacques. I must try to intercept them there. I should sail to the port of Le Francois and prevent them from taking my prisoner on their ship!
#TEXT   14
I've met Garcke's men, as I expected. Too bad for them... Time to talk with their boss - he must be upstairs with my prisoner!
#TEXT   15
The Portuguese was put in the room, our doctor is watching over him. I am so damn tired of this… I'd better walk around the town, I have got two days of rest.

I failed to find the Portuguese and I likely won't. Too bad.

I was able to catch Bartolomeo the Portuguese, yet I had to deal with his former companions who weren't really eager to let him live. I should talk with my prisoner when we are out of here, something is very wrong with him.
#TEXT   18
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate - 'Albatross'. Hugo feared him. I am victorious but there was no sign of Vazquez aboard... I'd better talk with my prisoner.
#TEXT   19
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate - 'Albatross'. I preferred to avoid fighting and escaped from the frigate. I should deliver the prisoner to Curacao but, first, I'd better talk with him.
#TEXT   20
Eh, I am too kind! I have been saving the Portuguese so often that I just can't let him be hanged. Hell with him, he may leave me in the first port...
#TEXT   21
Enough of sentimentalizing with this scum. I had enough of him… Heading to Curacao, to Matthias Beck.
#TEXT   22
It's done. The Portuguese was delivered to his judges and coins are mine. I have to admit, I am not satisfied by this story, Gino was damn right, saving man's life in order to hang him later... it's not right.
#TEXT   23
I decided to let Bartolomeo go, besides, he offered a good price for his freedom. He has got a hidden cache on Terks filled with gems which he has taken from the Company and they are also the reason why they are all hunting for him. I hope that he wasn't lying in order to save his life... He also warned me about Vazquez, he might be a problem in the future. Now I should look for a treasure before savages find it. What did he say? On the hill under the tree?
#TEXT   24
I witnessed a fight between Indians and Dutch marines. What are they doing here? Both sides didn't really appreciated me so I had to fight all of them. It was tough yet they are all dead and I am standing. Now I can search for the treasure.
#TEXT   25
The Portuguese didn't lie! I have found gems he was talking about. A proper ending for such an insane story.
#TEXT   26
I was engaged by a Dutch frigate near the shores of Terks. I fought them and destroyed them. I don't think that they came here just to walk around this cozy island, it is got to be something about Bartolomeo's treasure. Perhaps I will find something out in the nearest Dutch colony? I should talk with tavern folks.

Why should I care about Company's intrigues? After all, I have got the gems, it is all that matters...
#TEXT   29
It seems that I found out what is going on. Hernando Vazquez. He didn't risk to fight me on Martinique - I am sure he had a nice sight of his frigate's last fight. He wanted to save his life, that is why he told the Company about gems. And he didn't want to meet me at Curacao, that is why he came here, in Philipsburg. He sent Dutch expedition on Terks.
Well, Blood Don has been living enough, time to end him before he know about my presence here. I should go directly to the governor, I'd better ask his servants.
#TEXT   30
I have changed my mind. Vazquez is not a threat for me - Dutch won't let him live, they didn't find any gems on Terks. I can breath freely, I am confident…
#TEXT   31
Isn't that something! They have captured the Portuguese! They say that he and Vazquez will be executed in a month. It is obvious that the Company is going to interrogate them at first. I should decide what to do. The Portuguese might tell them about my role in this mess...
#TEXT   32
Bartolomeo is being held with his fellow Vazquez in Willemstad's dungeons. Ha! Should I take a risk? Or hell with it?
#TEXT   33
I decided to stay away from this risky and, what is more important, worthless gamble. Even if the Portuguese will open his mouth, well, he won't be able to tell much. There are hundreds of captains like me. Hell, he doesn't even know my name.
#TEXT   34
I have freed Bartolomeo from the prison, I barely made it, yet Vazquez attacked me from behind, thank God, Bartolomeo warned me and the shot wasn't lethal. Now there is nothing to worry about. I must admit, I did it for another reason. Like it or not, Gino was right, we are responsible for those who we tamed.

Waitress of San Jose tavern is desperate - she is confident that her brother who was put in the local dungeons for smuggling didn't die of illness as she was told. Perhaps, he might be in trouble and I could not stay indifferent to the tears of such a beautiful girl so I promised to help. It is odd that her brother died in two weeks after getting inside the dungeons. There is a probability that senor commandant is holding something back. I also should ask common folks about this strange epidemic, sometimes gossips are the best source of information.
#TEXT   2
Didn't get much from the innkeeper. Yet he confirmed my suspicions. It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year and no one would care. Or they just pretend? I also got one more clue, there was a smuggler who had been inside dungeons and survived. He died after all, yet it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should talk with his fellows - they might tell me some details.

Senor commandant didn't appreciate my interest. Even more, he tried to show me the door. Well, I admit, the man was extremely polite and patient. I will try to find out more about senor commandant.

Innkeeper has confirmed my suspicions.  It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year and no one would care. Or they just pretend? About senor commandant... He was sent here due to some of his machinations back in Europe. He fortified his house and never leave it without guards. The man is definitely hiding something. Something about consumption in his dungeons. I should check his house. I also got another clue. There was a smuggler who had been inside dungeons and lived.

My suspicions regarding senor commandant are getting stronger. They say that he was sent here due to some of his machinations back in Europe. He fortified his house and never leaves it without guards. The man is definitely hiding something. Something about consumption in his dungeons. I should check his house. I also got another clue. There was a smuggler who had been inside dungeons and lived. He died after all, yet it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should talk with his fellows - they might tell me some details.
#TEXT   6
It seems that our consumption has got a name. Juan. Whatever it means, it is not just another illness which kills people in prisons. I should ask the locals about this Juan.
#TEXT   7
I have found an interesting letter inside commandant's house. It looks like our colonel deals with a man whose name starts with 'J'. I also found coins, his share from the last deal.
Well, I am starting to understand what kind of cargo do they trade.
#TEXT   8
A Spanish officer approached me in the streets. He was looking disturbed and he begged me to stop asking people about Juan and consumption. He has appointed a meeting outside the town gates tonight. I feel that I am on the right way.
#TEXT   9
I was late and the Spanish doctor is gone. It seems that he was also taken by 'consumption'. Too bad.
#TEXT   10
Officer, who promised me to tell the truth about consumption, is dead. The only way to reach Juan is ended. Too bad. 
#TEXT   11
So, officer Sergio Saldo told me everything. Senor commandant is really selling his prisoners, formalizing their disappearances as deaths from consumption. Funny, his trading partner is called Consumption. Juan 'Consumption'. His men tried to kill us both during our meeting, it seems that I have alerted their gang. Time to find the rest of them and kill them all. Sergio told me that Juan's ship will be sailing not far from Galera Point till midday. It looks like Angelo still has got a chance to return home...
#TEXT   12
Fighting is done, the ship was sunk. Now I should return back to the waitress.
#TEXT   13
I have sunken Juan's ship with all prisoners it was carrying. What a shame! I have to be more careful next time...
#TEXT   14
Juan was too tough for me so I preferred to retreat, I care about my life's safety...
#TEXT   15
I was late to Galera Point and Juan's ship has gone... Damn it.
#TEXT   16
Juan, the slave trader, paid me well for his life. Young and noble officer Sergio will likely arrest senor commandant but Juan will find the way to continue his business. And the girl… well, she'd better stay ignorant about her brother's fate.
#TEXT   17
Juan has escaped from his deserved fate, I had to leave him in order to save slaves. Angelo will return to his sister and Consumption... perhaps, we shall meet again one day and I will be able to end what I've started...
#TEXT   18
End of the story. Consumption is dead and he will never continue his dirty hunt for people. Angelo will return to his sister just like a lot of other people will return back to their families today. I am not sure that senor commandant will be punished yet it is not my problem...

#TEXT   2
It's midnight already and I am too late to pick up my passengers.
#TEXT   3
All passengers are aboard, time to set sail. Odd group they are. A Spanish officer and a French officer. Both are very secretive and don't talk at all. What was a Spanish military doing on a French island? I have a bad feeling about this.
#TEXT   4
Ten days term has expired and I still haven't reached my destination. I should hurry.
#TEXT   5
My voyage to Maine took way too long and the scum passengers had started a mutiny. They are all dead now. Good riddance.
#TEXT   6
Passengers delivered. I should get as far as possible from the Spanish shores.
#TEXT   7
My guts were right, this deliver of Bertrand Pinette and his girls turned to be more profitable in terms of troubles than money. A runaway war captive, a deserter and a fraud - what a company. I am sure Pinette made a fortune on this voyage. As for me, I am obliged to find Pinette and bring him back to Guadeloupe. Nothing I can do about it, I am being blackmailed by this bastard banker. I should sail to Panama since it was my passengers' final destination. I also should remember to keep my mouth shut in the future!

I didn't find neither Pinette nor his ladies in Panama. Figures, he must had lied to me out of caution. I should head to Portobello now.

A bartender gave me a beautiful advise to directly address don Carlos de Milyar regarding Pinette. Nice. This would be the best way possible to end up in a local prison. The bartender's smug face tells me that he knows much more than he told me. I should persuade him to share with me.
#TEXT   10
So, no sign of Pinette here, although I managed to find a trail of the third passenger - the French deserter. He is a Spanish don now, a commander of the Sario. His reward for a treason, I imagine. I have no other option rather than to board his tub and to capture 'don Juan'. Even if he won't be able to point me to Bertrand's location, I could use him to ease the anger of the governor of Guadeloupe.

The Sario is in the open sea. I should chase her!

I made a mistake and attacked the Sario in port of Portobello. Jean-Juan is dead. All leads are gone and I have no clue where to find Pinette. I should expect troubles with French authorities.

I have a plan: there is a road from plantation to lighthouse of Barbados. I should station my ship near the lighthouse and set an ambush for Pinette near a crossroad between the town and plantation. I need to find a place where I could stay out of sight long enough. Surely, Bertrand constantly visits Bridgetown for business matters, therefore I don't think it will take more than a few days waiting for him.
#TEXT   21
I didn't dare to attack Pinette, he had a very impressive guard. Now I should run away, he saw my ambush and he will undoubtedly inform the commandant. Pity, now I should expect problems with French powers...

Pinette has offered me an interesting solution - a letter compromising the banker from Basse-Terre. Don Juan was right about aces in the man's hand. It would be a pleasure to look at the face of my blackmailer. Not to mention Bertrand's stash waiting for me in a cave of Guadeloupe.
#TEXT   25
Pinette's letter has made a lasting impression on the banker. He will keep his quite, that's for sure. I should check Bertrand's stash now, it's too risky to let it stay there for too long.

No way I am letting them get away with this. Gregoire Valinnie was right - patience is the key here. I should stay for a while in Saint-Pierre and see when the shipyard will start working again.

It didn't take too long. Two days, and the shipyard is working again as usual. I should pay a visit to the shipbuilder and look into his deceiving eyes.

It appears that there are not only hordes of bastards and scums around me. I have friends too! My good old noble acquaintance Gregoire Valinnie, on his own initiative only, has tracked down Felicien Gronier's most recent operations. The lieutenant has sailed to Guadeloupe on a fresh built tartane called 'Topaz'. I should follow him and find out what he's up to.

I took my time and let Felicien Gronier to slip away. No way I can compensate my losses now.
#TEXT   15
I've found the tartane around Guadeloupe, or to be more specific, near deserted shores of Morn l'O bay. Looks like they are unloading goods to the shore. I should wait for them to finish, disembark and 'confiscate' the resin they owe me. They can not escape from me there.
#TEXT   16
I've approached too close to the Topaz and alerted her crew: the tartane is sailing away to the open sea and there is an activity on the shores. I spoiled my own plan, no point to land there now, I am sure that bastards will manage to hide the merchandise in the jungles.
#TEXT   17
The Topaz has finished unloading and sailing away at the moment. I should wait for a few hours and then land on the shore. Time to get my resin back.
#TEXT   18
We've slaughtered the scum on the shore but it's not a victory yet. Lieutenant Felicien Gronier is here, in flesh. Looks like he had a feeling and decided to return. Great timing, you resin dog! He also has five serious fighters by his side. They are standing there like statues, waiting...
#TEXT   19
I didn't take my chances against Felicien Gronier's squad - they had that look. I'd rather stay with less plunder loot but alive. Half of resin is a very satisfying result anyway.
#TEXT   20
Felicien Gronier tried to threaten me, yet it didn't turn so well for him and his friends - they are staying forever on this shore. I made some calculations: even though there really was only a half of my resin, I also got ship silk, hemp ropes and iron wood in addition. My losses are compensated with profit!
#TEXT   21
The Topaz attacked me when I was leaving the bay. What made this small tartane to engage into her last fight - is a mystery to me.

I have decided not to participate in Caspar Gratton's games and sold out him and his squad to the commandant of Philipsburg without telling him about my role in all of this. I also volunteered to join the Dutch punitive squad.
#TEXT   16
It's done. The British raiding party had been eliminated, not without my help. No second thoughts - I wasn't the one who started this. I should pay a visit to the governor tomorrow and claim my reward.
#TEXT   17
Ten thousand pesos and a six month license of the Dutch West India Company! A splendid reward, though I worry about Brits learning about my part in all of this.
#TEXT   18
Jacobsen came up with a smart plan: he want to mix soldier wine with some gypsy dreaming potion. I had to pay for this with my own coin though... Caspar Gratton's bill is just scaling and scaling. I should come to the church same time tomorrow.
#TEXT   19
I have ruined Jacobsen's cunning play by being late to our meeting. Wonderful. Did he manage to sneak poisoned wine in prison? No clue what to do next. No, there is one - I should run away from here!
#TEXT   20
Jacobsen have arranged everything: tonight the prison guards will taste our dreaming wine. We should get down to releasing the prisoners by midnight. Caution is the key, I must avoid patrols in the streets.
#TEXT   21
So, Caspar Gratton and his men are coming to save their countrymen tonight and I will be escorting them right to a prison door... I doubt that Dutch uniform will do much in the streets, we absolutely must avoid patrols. Hope we'll be fortunate enough...
#TEXT   22
My great timing has ruined everything. This is shameful. I should get out of here.

I was late to the meeting at the city gates. I fear that the Brits went in town on their own and got catched by patrols. It's the end. I should get out of here.
#TEXT   24
We got exposed by patrols. I've managed to escape, same can't be said about my English friends. What a shame...
#TEXT   25
It's done! Now we should hurry to Grand Case beach and leave Saint-Martin as soon as possible.
#TEXT   26
It seems that we got exposed by the Dutch - there was an ambush on the beach. It was a tough fight but we prevailed.
#TEXT   27
Had a fight against a Dutch patrol vessel. Victory is mine, but it's not an end - corvette 'Zeepard' is on us. I shouldn't engage into this battle, it's time to sail to Antigua.

Finally I have delivered the Brits to Antigua. I should pay a visit to colonel Fox of Royal Marines tomorrow. I hope he'll be generous to me.
#TEXT   29
30 000 pesos, an arquebus and a decent blade. It's an adequate reward for my troubles, but this job is not something I'd do again.

#TEXT   2
Tortuga's interesting. Women here know what they want. Filled the ears of some pretty silly lass with my bullshit stories and there we are - I am invited to see her and her friends in a governor palace's bower tonight past six o'clock. In Europe women fancy noble artists of notorious families. In here, it's enough to have a ship. Brother was right, money was well spent.
#TEXT   3
I've changed my mind. No time for women business.

I didn't expect this. Or did I? The local governor's wife wanted me to rob that crazy fanatic. Sure, I need the coin, but not that desperately. The dame wasn't happy about this, but I am out of this story, clean and alive. Should I warn Levasseur about this? I should decide right now.
#TEXT   5
I have decided not to. Family business is a dirty mess.

The evening lost its lovely scent of romance very quickly. The local governor's wife wants to rob her husband. By my hands of course. Jewels are inside a chest. A duplicate key is already made and at this moment it is in the hands of some pirate who is sinking himself in a tavern bottle. How did it all go like that, I wonder? Is the dame playing me? Or is she stupid? At any rate, I need money, Michel will not leave his cell on his own.
#TEXT   7
I told Levasseur about his wife's plans, he didn't really like the news, got insane, gave me a beggar sum of coins and showed me the door. I think I am starting to feel sorry for his wife...
#TEXT   8
Too late to look for the pirate with a key in a tavern. Whatever, less intrigues - less troubles.
#TEXT   9
Screw this. It is all crystal now thanks to my new acquaintance. He was promised the very same boon and yet he was smart enough to drop this. I am not an idiot either. Should I warn the husband? I must decide now.

My meeting with the pirate was productive. Fifty doubloons for the duplicate key and a good advice. I should watch out for the Levasseur's bitch. She is clearly trying to play me.
#TEXT   11
The governor's wife wanted me to give her the duplicate key and see her next day for my share. Somehow I didn't feel very comfortable about this and refused. Time to find the chest and grab the booty.

I've changed my mind and decided not to help the wife in her endeavor. Too risky. I will get rid of the duplicate key and forget about this mess.
#TEXT   13
I have lock picked the Levasseur's chest, yet didn't return to his wife. Farewell, you sneaky bitch, ha-ha.
#TEXT   14
I've changed my mind and decided not to help the wife in her endeavor. Too risky. The very first stage of her plan ended with a bloodshed. I didn't even take the duplicate key from the pirate's body - I'd better forget about this mess.

My meeting with the pirate was productive. A bartender and his ladies are about to do a lot of cleaning. I have the duplicate key, time to see the wife.

Grandee Albalate
#TEXT   1
I helped a man called don Domingo Albalate tonight by getting him out of dirty mess. He is a young Spanish grandee and he asked me to pay him a visit in Santo-Domingo. His house is right to the city gates. 
#TEXT   2
I've decided not to go to Santo-Domingo. This is a Spanish city after all.
#TEXT   3
I wasn't met by don Domingo, instead there were some odd and aggressive characters. They must had been waiting for Albalate. I should search the place and investigate.
#TEXT   4
I've found a corpse of the real Ugo - don Domingo's retainer. There also was a curious unfinished note in a table: 'young senor, I don't understand what is really going on yet, but you are in a great danger. I know that such words mean nothing to you but, please, for the name of your father - please, leave the city as soon as you can! I've found documents of your uncle's...' Obviously, someone is after the young don. His old retainer tried to warn his master but they didn't let him to.
#TEXT   5
I've listened don Albalate's story and agreed to take him to his plantation in Portobello. He paid really well in advance, plus it's a good deed to help a young senor in trouble. Heading South with haste before young grandee's uncle returns from Cartagena.
#TEXT   6
It took too long for me to reach Portobello and don Albalate had lost his patience and left me.
#TEXT   7
Here we are on Portobello plantation. We should find a house of Luis Ortiz and search for any clues inside.
#TEXT   8
I've found Ortiz's accounting book. Domingo had fallen into great excitement after he read the notes - turns out that his uncle had been fooling him for years by lowering the real income in several times. Grandee Albalate is going to Portobello to address the court of law.
#TEXT   9
That was unexpected. Opposed by suddenly appeared don Luis Ortiz and his thugs, I have decided to leave them deal with their family matters on their own. Besides, I was paid well...
#TEXT   10
Don Diego and I had finally met Luis Ortiz face to face as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me but failed and now he is dead. Alas, the same can be said about poor grandee Albalate. What a shame... I should run away from here before the authorities consider me an accomplice.
#TEXT   11
Don Diego and I had finally met Luis Ortiz face to face as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me but failed and now he and his minions are feeding maggots. Don Domingo intends to immediately start dealing with his property, I should see him tomorrow and claim my reward.
#TEXT   12
This is the end of the curious case of don Albalate. Young grandee made a decision to get a grip on himself and take control over family business and as for me... I received an excellent reward for my doings.
#TEXT   13
We were late to Portobello and Luis Ortiz had taken care of any evidences. Don Domingo is going to deal with his situation in court. I wish him luck. I am not empty-handed though - grandee Albalate gifted me with his rapier.
#TEXT   14
I didn't find the young don in marquee Albalate's house, but instead I was met by his retainer named Ugo. He got extremely nervous when he heard news about the attack on his master and ran straight to a commandant. I was literally turned out the place. Fine, I can live without their famous Spanish 'hospitality'.

The Final Lesson
#TEXT   1
Today I met Gregoire Valinnie - the very nobleman who was so kind to me on my first day in this region. It feels like it was ages ago. He offered to join him in a very promising business and I agreed. We should get to Boca de la Serpienta coast in a week, land there with a squad of fighters, find the expedition, suppress the Indian resistance and seize the Company's goods. Sounds both risky and profitable.
#TEXT   2
Damn it! Gregoire Valinnie was killed in action. No point to continue absent my partner. Rest in peace, friend.
#TEXT   3
We didn't risk giving the decisive skirmish to the Caribs - we have too few men for this. Better stay without plunder, yet alive. We are leaving.

Flames! Such a stupidity... They must have taken away all the goods already. Gregoire Valinnie was pissed off and left my squadron...
#TEXT   5
We have managed to salvage a part of the cargo from the Carib lair before we were interrupted by English and Dutch vanguards. We should get the away from here. Our total plunder: @<sSanl> of ironwood, @<sSilk> of ship silk, @<sRope> of ropes and @<sOil> of resin. Heading back to Saint-Pierre, Martinique.

Victory. Bloody and pointless such as it is. No way we seize the prize with such casualties. Dammit!

We are about to conclude a bargain tonight at Lamentin Bay. Soon we'll have the money and others will have an illegal cargo. My partner is a man of foresight, no doubt in that.

I can't say for sure that it was the toughest fight in my life. But I am alive, I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach swimming in blood.

It was learnt in full.

I should either find and acquire the amber or prove the story to be nothing but a drunk boasting. My money on the latter. I should go to Santo Domingo and find there a whore by the name of Gabriela Chapada. I have only three days before the information losses any value.

It took too long for me to get to Santo Domingo. No way I can find that Spanish captain now. What a shame to loose a chance to work for a famous pirate just like that....
#TEXT   3
Gabriela told me about the name of my brave military - Esberdo Cabanas. He has sailed to Havana in order to acquire means to prospect the amber. Perhaps he was actually telling the truth... I should set sail to Cuba now.

It took too long for me to investigate in Havana. What a shame to loose a chance to work for a famous pirate just like that....

I was told in a harbor office that the Cantavro is on patrol but her location is classified. I am not stupid enough to address a commandant regarding such matters. I should seek for another way to get information I need.
#TEXT   6
I have arrive at Cuba. No sign of the Cantavro. I should go to the city and investigate.
#TEXT   7
Looks like I know a way to find captain Esberdo Cabanas! An enemy of my enemy is a potential friend of mine. I doubt that the imprisoned officer has any warm feelings to his former captain. I should pay a visit to this lover of wine and women.

Ha! That's a start! All I need is to help my good friend Lope... I should see a governor.
#TEXT   9
It's too late to help the prisoner now. Now way I can not to chase down the Cantavro now. What a shame.

Tyrex must be testing the limits of my patience. Instead of hunting down trading caravans, I am to find a regular buyer for a rare commodity - ship silk. I have no clue where to begin with. Anyway, first I should meet with Bald Geffrey, captain of a galleon called Snake, in Capsterville of St. Christopher.
#TEXT   2
I have wasted too much time and Bald Geffrey must had already decided to act on his own without waiting instructions from Tyrex. What a shame...
#TEXT   3
Why thank you, Tyrex! Smugglers offer a price Marcus won't accept. Stores are not an option. Someone must be in need of it since smugglers are clearly re-sell it to someone out there. I should use my brains here - who are the main consumers of ship silk? This will help me to find a buyer.
#TEXT   4
I had a talk with a shipbuilder of Capsterville but it didn't bear any fruits, but I think I am on the right path. This shipbuilder needed ropes from Russia, but who would need a silk from Lyons?
#TEXT   5
I have found my potential silk buyer. Alas, we didn't get along. Either he believes me to be a snitch or he simply doesn't want to do business with unfamiliar people. There was a spark in his eyes when I mentioned the silk... I bet the sly dog already has a regular source of silk and it's not a governor. Pressing the master won't do any good here, I should better look for his suppliers. There is a pirate lair on Jamaica - Maroon Town. I should go there and investigate.
#TEXT   6
A bartender of Maroon Town can point me to a man who knows everything about what's going on in these waters. I must find 50 doubloons for the greedy bastard.

Looks like I need someone called Husky Billy, an ex pirate who is know fishing around Jamaica on his old long boat. I should wait for him not far Negril Cape. His tub is called the Fly Fish.
#TEXT   8
Billy can point me to the silk supplier, yet he asks a new long boat plus a roll of ship silk in return. I have three days to deliver him all of this before he sail away to the open sea.
#TEXT   9
According to Husky Billy, every month between 10th and 15th some brigantine called Utrecht smuggles ship silk to a head master of Port Royal's ship builder. I need to get rid of my competitor. Should I sink them all away from the shores to avoid suspicions? Or perhaps I could inform the governor? Either way, this will make client to be much more agreeable.
#TEXT   10
I didn't deliver a long boat and silk to Husky Billy in time. The pirate must be far away by now. No point to tell Tyrex about my failure.
#TEXT   10-1
It's been a week and there is no sign of the Flying Fish. I must had missed it's appearance. Shame, no need to bother Tyrex now.
#TEXT   11
So, the Utrecht is at the bottom of the sea and so are my competitors. I should land at Portland bay to talk with the buyers.
#TEXT   12
Damn it! The bay is empty, someone was here just recently but they are all gone by now. I must had engaged into a fight too close to the shores. I doubt the shipbuilder can be persuaded in the light of recent events. No point to go seeing Tyrex now. It's a total failure.
#TEXT   13
I have missed the Utrecht. I was so close yet failed to find the brigantine on the horizon.
#TEXT   14
A failure! I have wasted my chance to make a deal with the worker, he took me for a patrol officer, got scared and foolishly attacked me. Idiot. I had to kill them all, shame, but this is over.
#TEXT   15
It's done. I managed to struck a deal with the worker. 25 doubloons for a roll. Now I should sail to St. Cristopher and see Bald Geffrey.
#TEXT   16
It's been two months already. Bald Geffrey must had already sold his silk to someone else. Pity... but I think I can still deliver the information about the buyer to Tyrex. I should get to La Vega in ten days in order to give Tyrex some time to gather enough silk. Hope it will ease his possible anger.
#TEXT   17
All terms are long due. No point making Tyrex nervous by my very presence.
#TEXT   18
It's been two months already and I still have no leads to possible buyers. It's a total failure, no need to go to Tyrex at this point.

I say fools are much happier people than ones with brains. All you have to do is to follow orders and swing swords. And I should come up with a rescue plan which is a no small task.

Pelly the Cutlass got orders to sail to Maracaibo, drop an anchor at Guajira Bay and wait for my arrival. It will take a week for the Moray to get there. As for myself, I should go straight to the heart of the beast - a Maracaibo plantation. Jean Picard must be somewhere on it. I suppose I should pretend being a slave trader in order to avoid causing any suspicions. Fifty slave heads will make it look trustworthy enough.

I've found Jean but it is unwise to discuss his escape in the presence of guards. I should wait for a night and find Picard in one of shacks.
#TEXT   7
Plan's simple and blunt. Picard's men rise a riot and I along with Pelly the Cutlass will attack them from outside. However I should arm Jean's pirates first. 30 common sabers and axes can be taken from the ship's arsenal. The rest must be gathered on my own. 30 pistols and charges for them. Up to 90 potions. Also it would not hurt to have 2 muskets with 20 charges to each. I should see Pelly now.
#TEXT   8
Weapons were gathered. I should think on how to deliver it secretly to plantation. I suppose, it's time I have a talk with Picard about it.
#TEXT   9
Picard is not an idiot which makes him different from other Tyrex's pawns. The weapons will get to plantation in boxes with goods for trade. I should offer them 500 boxes of either coffee or copra or vanilla.
#TEXT   10
The goods exchange agreement was made, the deal will be struck tomorrow evening. I should find Picard and let him know.

I have wrecked the deal by not bringing enough goods for exchange. Shame that it all was ruined by me stupidity...

So, I am supposed to take my ship to Guajira Bay and get ready to storm the plantation with Pelly on my side before midnight.

I didn't show up at the plantation in time. Our rescue plan is completely ruined...

I must had been too slow with gathering weapons for the rescue. Jean Picard and his men are gone from plantation - either they were sold to another place or tortued to death. It's over.

Robbery well done. My cut must be exceeding 100 000 pesos which covers Lavoisier's debt to me. Plus, I didn't allow Jean to kill a witness - a whore belonging to Tyrex. I am probably getting soft but a women on Isla Mona can be a benefit, he-he. She won't run away from there anyway.
#TEXT	17
We parted our ways with Jean Picard at Gonaives Bay. He told me he is quitting and suggested that I should do the same. His words regarding Tyrex are somewhat true butЙ not now. Now I should see Marcus and report him about Ignacio Marco.
#TEXT	18
We wasted too much time in the jungles on a road to La Vega and didn't risk to do a robbery. Jean was very upset. I should see Marcus and report him about Ignacio Marco.
#TEXT	19
I have completely forgotten about Jean Picard's offer! Pity.

#QUEST Roger_5
Flying the Jolly Roger: Stones of Blood and Forest
#TEXT	1
My next mission to locate and plunder a Spanish mining village called Merida. Jean Picard will accompany me in this. Tyrex also provided me with one of his buccaneers - Luka Bayard also known as Leprechaun. I should meet him and his men in La Vega's port.
#TEXT	2
I was taken away by other matters and now Picard with Leprechaun had left my ship. What a shame...
#TEXT	3
Our goal is Cape of Delusive Hopes, South of Maracibo Lake. No time to waste!
#TEXT	4
Here we are in the Spanish Maine. We should find an Indian village and have a talk with their chieftain about a guide to Merida.
#TEXT	5
The chieftain is not a talkative type. Leprechaun was right - no way I am doing this without gifts.
#TEXT	6
An Indian chieftain by the name of Kumwana has promised me to gather his warriors and have a talk with them. I should see him tomorrow morning to get an answer.
#TEXT	7
Redskin chickens! Not a single soul wanted to guide me to Merida - they fear some Capongas in the jungles... This is a problem, I should talk to Leprechaun.
#TEXT	8
Not sure it will work but I have no other option here. I should try to gain any luck by gifting and persuading their women. One of them might presuade her husband to help us. I also should bring antidotes to the Leprechaun before we leave the village.
#TEXT	9
An Indian girld named Hayami promised me to have a word with her husband Tagofa. I should see them both after a sunset.
#TEXT	10
Tagofa agreed to guide us to Merida. But his sly woman demanded to pay forward: two handguns - a Duelling Pistol and a Trombone along with thirty charges to each. Also, a spyglass, an emerald necklace and a golden ring with a ruby.
#TEXT	11
Tagofa has joined my unit. In order to reach Merida we need six long boats. Since Lokonos don't posses decent long boats, we are going to build them. For this it is required twenty packs of planks, ten bales of leather and an officer to lead the building - an assigned carpenter.
#TEXT	12
It didn't take long to persuade a governor of Merida to part with all mined stones. Picard was right - it's a heavy booty. Nothing to do here now. Time to go back to our longboats.
#TEXT	13
Reckless Capongas had us ambushed inside the cave. Had to put another group of theirs down.
#TEXT	14
Longboats are ready. I should break a word with Tagofa.
#TEXT	15
We were attacked by the very Capongas I have heard so much about recently. They are all dead now and Merida is close to us.
#TEXT	16
The Spanish turned to be way too suspecious and aggressive - they didn't think twice before charging on my unit. The very last mistake in their lifes... Merida's garrison is eliminated, all of her protectors are dead. Time to break the gates.
#TEXT	17
The last Spanish eager for a glorious death are dead now. Time to pay the governor a visit.
#TEXT	18
The booty was split fairly. My efforts to release Jean from slavery were also compensated in full. Fortunate me. Time to go to La Vega and report to Tyrex.
#TEXT	19
It took too much time for me to gather gifts for the red skinned couple. Leprechaun along with Jean decided they can do better without me. Probably for the best!
#TEXT	20
I was too slow so Leprechaun along with Jean decided they can do better without me. Probably for the best!
#TEXT	21
I was too slow so Leprechaun along with Jean decided they can do better without me. Probably for the best!

#QUEST Roger_6
Flying the Jolly Roger: Master of Trickery
#TEXT	1
Alas, Marcus doesn't have another profitable job for me. Howeverthe Master of Codex has a personal task - I should escort the Kitty to Bridgetown of Barbados. I am obliged to please my patron... The ship is in the waters of La Vega at the moment.
#TEXT	2
Looks like I drank too much rum since the Kitty is gone to Bridgetown on her own. What a shame...
#TEXT	3
The Kitty was sunken in a naval combat. What a shame... No way I am showing up to Marcus now.
#TEXT	4
Well-well! I was approached by Ignacio Marco in Bridgetown! He offered me to partner him in an attack of a Dutch silver caravan. The Marco who set Jean Picard up. I agreed to his offer, the prize is too promising but I should be careful with this man. Funny, the caravan has made a stop on an already familiar island to me...
#TEXT	5
Well-well! I was approached by Ignacio Marco in Bridgetown! He offered me to partner him in an attack of a Dutch silver caravan. The Marco who set Jean Picard up. I agreed to his offer, the prize is too promising but I should be careful with this man. The caravan has made a stop near the island with the following coordinates: 12 48' North, 64 41' West.
#TEXT	6
The caravan is indeed here. Ignasio Marco didn't lie. Very well, time to free the Dutch of their cargo.
#TEXT	7
The fighting with the Dutch is over. Ignasio Marco is signalling me from his polacre, looks like he wants me to go ashore to split the plunder, obviously. I am about to go there but also I will put a watchman over the nearest hill armed with a spyglass... I need to be sure the horizon stays clear. 
#TEXT	8
My precaution has served me well - this bastard Ignasio Marco works in cooperation with Castillians. It is the very same scenario happened to Picard. A job with a partner near South Maine, then splitting the spoils and then the Spanish squadron. If it wasn't for my watchman, they would have had me just like they had Picard. I still have time to flee... I guess. 
#TEXT	9
I am not sure I should engage this Spanish squadron. I believe fleeing is the best possible option in situation like this. It will take no less than 3000 yards between us for me to have a chance of fleeing.
#TEXT	10
I had engaged into a tough battle against the Spanish heavy squadron and eliminated it. Now they know what is like to fight a real corsair... I should hurry and see Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT	11
I've managed to flee from the Spanish squadron. I should hurry and see Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT	12
The El Casador, the flagship is eliminated. Now we can try to flee - all we need is 1000 yards distance from them.

#QUEST Roger_7
Flying the Jolly Roger: Jarl's Treasures
#TEXT	1
And yet another puzzle quest from Tyrex: I should go to god-knows-where and find treasures of a recently dead pirate by the name of WulfricJogansen. All I have is his log. I should go to my cabin and take my time, to try getting the most of this log.
#TEXT	2
I got a lead from Wulfric's ship log - the Mosquito Bay. Is seems that he had been visiting with an extreme frequency. This bay leads to a couple of caves deep in the mainland. I should investigate them.
#TEXT	3
I was attacked by enraged Caribs in a grotto of Mosquitoes Bay. Looks like I've interrupted some rite they were performing around a fireplace. It never gets easy. Now I can search for the treasure in peace.
#TEXT	4
Alas, no sign of any treasures inside the grotto at Mosquitoes Bay.
#TEXT	5
I have found a chest with quite an interesting content, although I am sure it's not Red Wulf's treasure.
#TEXT	6
I've met some beggars on the exit of the cave. Looks like it was their cache I found earlier.
#TEXT	7
This lead was false. I should had expected more from Red Wolf. He was not like the rest unfortunate bastards who hide their belongings inside road caves. I should go to my cabin and try again.
#TEXT	8
Okay, I have another lead. Wulfric had been regularly visiting some Gaspard Parmentier at Tortuga... He could the Viking's personal banker. I should investigate.
#TEXT	9
I was told of how to find Gaspard's place. I should go there and careful inquire about Red Wolf. It's better to pay a visit during a day. Bankers do not fancy night guest, he-he.
#TEXT	10
Gaspard Parmentier's house close. I knocked the door several times and nothing happened. However I heard someone walking inside the house. This banker is clearly hiding from the men like me. Men he doesn't know. I should stand near the hatch to the dungeons and observe the entrance.
#TEXT	11
Blimey! My old friend Pelly the Cutlass has arrived to Gaspard and the door magically opened for him. This is insulting. I should wait for Cutlass to leave and then ask him around Gaspard. Pelly is an idiot, he will tell me everything I need to know.
#TEXT	12
Bad lead again! Gaspard Parmentier, also known as Goldenteeth, is an ordinary buyer of stolen gems and jewelsЙ I should go to my cabin and try again.
#TEXT	13
There is a word 'gord' often written there and there. What the hell is 'gord'? I should find it out since I have no more solid leads to investigate. My friend Gino can help me in this scientific matter. Heading to Antigua.
#TEXT	14
There is a word 'gord' often written there and there. What the hell is 'gord'? I should find it out since I have no more solid leads to investigate. Heading to La Vega, I need to ask Tyrex for help in this.
#TEXT	15
So, our Wulfric the Viking had a personal secret base within the Archipelago! I bet that's where his treasure lies. I should go to my cabin and try to calculate it's location using the man's ship log.
#TEXT	16
I think I have the location of gord I am looking for. It's on an island not marked on any map. I should explore it.
#TEXT	17
I was suddenly attacked in the jungles by a horde of pirate. Must be Wulfric's men unaware of his fate. I should gather a boarding party and proceed.
#TEXT	18
This is it, I have found Wulfric's gord. Only three of his men survived and they are in my crew now. A carpenter named Rodgar and two of his helpers. Time to search for the treasure. It must be hidden here. And hidden well.
#TEXT	19
I have found Red Wolf's treasures. Helluva money: 750 000 pesos and 900 doubloons. A third goes to Tyrex, the rest is mine by right. I will keep the secret of this island to myself. This is now my base, my gord. I can repair ships and store goods here. One day I might build and expand here.
#TEXT	20
I have my very own base from now on! It's coordinates are: 18 42' North, 72 9' West. Island is called Isla Mona. Rodgar Janssen will stay here overseeing the village and repairing my ships. Time to see Tyrex and report to him.

#QUEST Roger_8
Flying the Jolly Roger: Corrida
#TEXT	1
Marcus have ordered me to investigate the situation at Martinique. They say Ignacio Marco was seen there. I should go there and watch the bastard. I am forbidden to attack him though - Marcus has his own plans towards him.
#TEXT	2
The Torero is on a raid of Le Francois accompanied by a frigate and a corvette. My friend must be here thenЙ I should go to Le Francois and avoid asking anyone about Marco and his crew. My task to watch and observe.
#TEXT	3
Ignacio Marco had spent almost two hours in the residence of Jacques Barbason - a head of Le Francois. Then he headed towards a port along with two serious gentlemen who probably captains of other two ships. I should hurry to St. Pierre and try to pursue them further.
#TEXT	4
Ignacio Marco has already sailed away when I reached my ship. Whatever. I got some valuable information, I should tell Marcus about it.
#TEXT	5
I failed to arrive to Marcus in three weeks and his plan was ruined. What a shame. Nevertheless I am still in business - I should come back in a month on a single powerful ship. And never be late again.
#TEXT	6
So, I am to execute a complex plan of Marcus. First stage: I must intercept the Torero which is heading to Philipsburg from Cuba. I'd better attack her near Saint-Martin but not too close to the island, Barbason's pirate may notice the fight otherwise.
#TEXT	7
I have sunken the Torero in the heat of fight. What a shame. I should go to Marcus.
#TEXT	8
I have successfully boarded the Torero yet failed to find her log. No way I am getting the information we need. What a shame. I should go to see Marcus.
#TEXT	9
I have launched a fight with the Torero too close to Saint-Martin and had been spotted by other pirates. What a shame. I should go to see Marcus.
#TEXT	10
I have successfully boarded the Torero. Ignacio Marco didn`t surrender yet I still have his log. I should go to my cabin and investigate it.
#TEXT	11
Now I have all information I needed. Pigeon Spyke is on his way to Tyrex, now it`s time to signal Barbason's squadron near Saint-Martin to sail to Puerto-Rico. I should keep my distance though. 1500 yards from Philipsburg`s fort will suffice.
#TEXT	12
What a shame. I have given the wrong signal to Barbason`s pirates. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT	13
What a shame. I got to close to Barbason`s pirates and compromised the Torero`s true legend. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT	14
The signal was sent! The pirates are sailing right to Puerto-Rico where the Spanish ambush have been set. I should hurry to intercept the gold caravan. Hope Marcus`s reinforcements will be there in time.
#TEXT	15
What a shame! I`ve wasted too much time and failed to locate the Spanish gold caravan. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT	16
What a shame! I`ve totally forgotten Marcus`s instructions not to add any ships beside the Torero to my squadron. Now the pirate will be chasing me for a while. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT	17
The promised reinforcements didn`t disappoint me — Marcus himself has arrived to aid me on the Red Dragon, his warship! The Spanish are gone. I should take a longboat!
#TEXT	18
Sadly, we didn`t get any gold from this. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming.
#TEXT	19
Sadly, we didn`t get as much gold from this as we hoped for. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming.
#TEXT	20
The plunder was good though Tyrex had hopes for more. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming, I hope it will be bigger that this raid.
#TEXT	21
Tyrex and I were pleased by the size of our prize. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming, I hope it will be bigger that this raid.
#TEXT	22
Despite my fail, Tyrex wasn`t really mad at me. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming, I hope it will be bigger that this raid.
#TEXT	23
I was too late — Tyrex has already gone to the raid. What a shame!
#TEXT	24
I failed to find the Torero in the high seas. Everything`s lost… I shout get back to Marcus.

Yo-ho-ho! Me with Marcus, Bold Geffrey, Cutlass Pelly, Luke Leprechaun and Tyrex`s friend Bernard Vensan are about to raid Cartagena! There is a pile of gold waiting for us inside the city`s fort, not to mention ransom we will get from the townsfolk. A great life it is  except a hangover, ha-ha! Helluva party we had yesterday, the booze, the girls — La Vega has much to offer to Charley Prince, I am being respected in this place! I love this life!
#TEXT	2
I am an idiot beyond measure! My exceptional navigation skills made the other to abandon me!
#TEXT	3
Here is the city of Cartagena. My first task is to eliminate guard ships.
#TEXT	4
The Spanish squadron has been eliminated. I should get aboard the Red Dragon.
#TEXT	5
Tyrex and me are going to bombard Cartagena`s fort. It bothers me a bit but the Red Dragon is a fort of herself.
#TEXT	6
The resistance has been terminated. Cartagena is ours! Marcus is heading to fort for the gold and I am ordered to get a ransom from a governor.
#TEXT	7
I made the Spanish to pay even more than Marcus wanted — the ransom of 350 000 pesos is acquired. Heading to the fort.
#TEXT	8
The gold of Cartagena has been loaded on our ships. My cut is @<sGold> pieces of gold and @<sMoney> pesos. It`s a rich prize and it`s an fair split... mostly. I didn`t really like that Marcus split the gold without me, plus he took a fucking half of it! I agree, the lead was his and he had the biggest ship… Never mind, I have a new order, I should head to Tortuga and put my coin to good waste there. Whores and rum, I will not disappoint you!

#QUEST Roger_10
Flying the Jolly Roger: Nemesis
#TEXT	1
Life`s good! Janette`s brothel will remember me for a fucking long time, ha-ha! Costed me quite a penny but I have a new lead already: my new girlfriend, Camilla, is offering me a treasure map to a lost city of gold miners. I am sure this is not a com since the girl was going to sell it to Marcus in the first place. She will be waiting for me in  the church from 10 am till 1 pm. I should prepare 200 doubloons for her.
#TEXT	2
I have Camilla`s map. I should study it and get ready for anything. I need to prepare munitions, healing potions, antidotes in case things will turn ugly.
#TEXT	3
Here it is — Caratasca Lagoon. A wild and deserted shore. Here my journey to the ruins begins.
#TEXT	4
An obstacle! I clear my way with explosive for certain. Someone have already been here not so long ago. Heading back to my ship to get gun powder.
#TEXT	5
Barrels filled with gun powder are ready. I should light a fuse and get to cover.
#TEXT	5-1
My plan worked perfectly! The path is clear!
#TEXT	6
I`ve found the ruins. Somewhere here must a way to dungeons where the treasure is buried.
#TEXT	7
Camilla, this bitch! He sold the map not only to me but also to Cutlass! I would never thought that greed can blind a man like this. We used to be good partners… Seems like the poor bastard was always envying me.
I`ve found the treasures but they are protected by metal bars. I should get instruments from the ship.
#TEXT	8
Fuck!.. It hurts! Jeffrey had set me up! Greedy bastard! A second `friend` from the Brethren who tried to kill me today because of gold. I should get the hell out of here right now. This is so wrong. Who else is going to meet me here? Picard? We had an agreement, but nothing is certain anymore. Geffrey`s men are still around, I heard the scum mentioned a musketeer unit he brought here.
#TEXT	9
Sadly instead of Jean, I`ve met Luke Leprechaun here. He and his buccaneers had set an ambush upstairs. Turned out the old forester always had a grudge towards me. So much for signing bandits and pirates as friends!
I do not see all of this as a game of chance. Something is in the air, I should get the hell out of here!
#TEXT	10
All of this had been orchestrated... A fucking avenger of the people set a trap for me. The man`s name is don Henrico and the worst part is that his accusations are all just and true.
I am all alone here, in this dark, creepy and silent dungeons. I am surrounded by the dead even rats are not present here. I still have time to find a way out before starvation kills me.
#TEXT	11
I`ve found a rusty key on a skeleton and it opens a door leading downstairs. Perhaps it is a way out?
#TEXT	12
I woke up in cold sweat. How long had I been asleep? I had terrible nightmares of Merida in flames and her dead citizens.  My brother Michelle was there too. He said something about a key... near me? On the stairs?
#TEXT	13
It's a miracle! I've found an old silver key on the stairs!
#TEXT	14
I've found another dungeon. It's flooded and has a very close resemblance to the entrance of Hell. It's hot in here and there is a deep smell of sulfur around. I have no idea where to go next plus I should worry about hot gazers bursting from the rifts.
#TEXT	15
I've reached some cave and it has fresh and cool water to ease a pain from sulfur air and burns. The air is different here, must be the exit nearby!
#TEXT	16
I recognize this place! I've been here on my way to the ruins! Soon I will see the sea! 
#TEXT	17
I did it! It's a second birth no less... I believe I've earnt such punishment. I am a monster.
Time to part my ways with Marcus Tyrex and the piracy. I will meddle in their affairs again, I am sure of it but I will never be one of them again. Pirate Charley Prince died in the dungeons of dead city.
